## Features
The indicators shown in the center of the screen when you first start the application can be moved anywhere on the screen.
I usually put it alongside the taskbar control icons.

<br>
You can change the size of the indicators by changing the default value 35 from .init file.
You can also choose both the sequence of the indicators (the default is perc,freq,temp) and which indicator to show by modifying the .init text file automatically created in the same folder as the executable.
For example to change the order just change perc,freq,temp to freq,perc,temp or to show only cpu usage and temperature change to perc,temp

Hovering the mouse over the indicators shows the numerical value of the moment.

<br>
<br>
By clicking the right mouse button over the indicators, the application is closed.
The middle button restarts the application. This is useful in case the system has been idle.
<br>
<br>
## Installation
Copy the executable file to any folder dedicated to it. In this folder the configuration files `.init` will be created.<br>
You can create your own [Desktop Entry].
